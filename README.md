# Tomato Leaf Disease Classification [Web App](http://206.189.38.229:5000)
## Overview
8 categories of tomato leaves from [PlantVillage](https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset) as dataset to train the [Keras model](https://github.com/reubenloo/tomato/tree/master/KerasModel). It was then converted to a [TensorflowJS model](https://github.com/reubenloo/tomato/tree/master/public/tfjs-models/PlantVillage) and deployed using a [NodeJS Express server](https://github.com/reubenloo/tomato/blob/master/server.js) on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).
 
## Built With
* [Keras](https://keras.io/) - High level neural network API, running on top of Tensorflow
* [TensorflowJS](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) - Library for machine learning in Javascript
* [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) - Minimalist web framework for NodeJS
* [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) - Cloud hosting provider
